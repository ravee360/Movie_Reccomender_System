# Movie Reccomender System
A movie recommender system is an ML model that suggests movies based on user input movie.The method used is content-based filtering, which recommends movies based on attributes such as genre, cast, or directors that match a user's input movie.The goal is to personalize recommendations, helping users discover new movies that align with their tastes and improving their overall viewing experience.
In this model I have used following python libraries ; Numpy, Pandas, sklearn etc. Data for the same is downloaded from the Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).
